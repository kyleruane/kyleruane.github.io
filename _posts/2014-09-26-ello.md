Ello is a new social network promising to remain ad-free while keeping user information from third parties. Yes, we’ve heard this before (e.g. app.net) but, unlike other options that have popped up, Ello has a certain unfinished quality that adds to its charm. It feels like the emphasis is on communication and that the rest will evolve around that—a welcome notion compared the the big business social media has become, which also appears to fall right in line with the ethos.

From the [manifesto](https://ello.co/wtf/post/manifesto): 

_“We believe a social network can be a tool for empowerment. Not a tool to deceive, coerce, and manipulate — but a place to connect, create, and celebrate life. You are not a product.”_

It is currently buggy, and I have a little trouble seeing what it aims to be, but Ello could be hitting at just the right time. With many Facebook users tired of Farmville invites and the noise on Twitter at an all-time high, simplicity is looking more and more attractive to more and more people.
