<br>I was recently challenged through a tweet to blog on my personal site every weekday for 30 days. Despite the lack of structured rules and constraints for this particular endeavor (there’s a few different ways to interpret the 30 day timeframe alone) and the general shoot-from-the-hip arrogance exuding from such a statement, I plan on diving in head-first and letting the bullshit flow—I’d like to write more anyway and I’ve never been one to back down from a challenge. In the infamous words of various instances of Marty McFly throughout history, “Nobody calls me chicken!” 

I predict that within 10 days I will be entirely out of material I am comfortable with, which should be when this really gets interesting—or utterly unreadable. Stay tuned.
