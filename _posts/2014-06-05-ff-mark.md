![FF Mark]({{site.blog_img_path}}2014/ffmark.jpg)

<br>A collaboration between some typographic heavy-hitters including _[FontFont](https://www.fontfont.com/)_ and _[Hannes Von Döhren](http://hvdfonts.com/)_ (of HVD Fonts and Brandon/Pluto fame) has yielded a new geometric typeface, FF Mark. Besides being absolutely gorgeous and complete with a significant amount of available weights and figure options, FF Mark has a preview site that is nothing short of amazing. Unlike many other type foundries, this site genuinely feels fresh and pushes the boundaries web design in general—all while doing a perfect job of showing off the details of the typeface.

Part of the description of FF Mark on the site states that it is _“Strong, simple, bold and created with utmost consideration and precision.”_ What a fitting way to show it off.
