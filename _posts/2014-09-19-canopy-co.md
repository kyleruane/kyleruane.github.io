[Canopy](http://canopy.co/) is a slick website that curates Amazon products, showing only ones of a certain aesthetic, and presents the user with a superior browsing experience. You still purchase through Amazon, but the discovery of new items is much more enjoyable because of a clean design that lets product images speak for themselves. Without being told differently, I’m fairly certain you would mistake the site for an indie shop.

<br>The best part? Since you’re still buying through Amazon, the prices are great. Check it out: [http://canopy.co/](http://canopy.co/)
