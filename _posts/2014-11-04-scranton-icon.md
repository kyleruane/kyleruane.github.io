I put out an APB yesterday for things in Scranton that are “staples” of the area. I have an idea for a design, and want to represent Scranton with iconography of its history and culture. I started with a decent list, but am really interested in what others associate with Scranton (other than the Office).

Below is a running list of ideas and things—to be updated for sure.

+ Coal, mines, mining (via [@NEPA_MOM](https://twitter.com/NEPA_MOM))
