Taking a cue from friend and fellow [coalworker](http://coalwork.com/) [Joe Casabona](http://casabona.org/2014/10/podcasts-listen-every-week/), I decided to list the various podcasts I listen to, have listened to and plan on listening to. Perhaps you’ll find something interesting here worth a listen or two.

Some context—I usually listen to podcasts when traveling, which is infrequent (need music when working, more on that [here](http://kyleruane.com/blog/10001/work-day-jams)). So, I meander in and out of different shows and am not a hardcore, can’t-miss-an-episode fan of anything.  

Tech, web and design-themed podcasts, in no particular order:

[Overtired](http://5by5.tv/overtired)<br>
[CMD+Space](http://5by5.tv/cmdspace)<br>
[Happy Monday](http://www.happymondaypodcast.com/)<br>
[The Talk Show](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-talk-show-with-john-gruber/id528458508?mt=2)<br>
[Life+Limb](http://www.lifeandlimb.com/)<br>
[Connected](http://relay.fm/connected)

Podcasts unrelated to (my) work, also in no particular order:

[Welcome to Night Vale](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/welcome-to-night-vale/id536258179?mt=2)<br>
[Nerdist](http://www.nerdist.com/podcast_channel/nerdist-podcast-channel/)<br>
[Lies](http://www.nerdist.com/podcast_channel/lies-with-sara-schaefer/)<br>
[Serial](http://serialpodcast.org/)
