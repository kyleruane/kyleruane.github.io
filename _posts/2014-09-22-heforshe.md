Emma Watson, actress from the Harry Potter movie series and recent goodwill ambassador for U.N. Women, gave a succinct speech before the United Nations announcing a new initiative called HeForShe, calling for a unified effort for gender equality. And, in doing so, she described the issues at hand in the most approachable way I think I’ve ever heard. Aside from the obvious discrepancies between men’s and women’s wages, voices and rights, she describes some other interesting facets of sexism including it’s effect on men along with the often misunderstood term “feminism.”

The speech is excellent and is something everyone should watch. You can catch the Cliff’s Notes version on the [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/22/emma-watson-recruits-men-to-make-the-world-safer-for-women-with-heforshe-campaign/) or see the entire video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Dg226G2Z8&feature=youtu.be).
