Welp. Like many others out there I spent the shitstorm that was the calendar year of 2017 generally avoiding posting things online. Aside from watching the country go down in flames and discovering out most everyone I know IRL is basically racist, I moved across Pennsylvania from Scranton to its cultural twin Pittsburgh, joining the crew at Cotton Bureau.

I've been busy enough that I haven't really thought about my site, let alone considering updating it. One of my goals for 2018 is to share more here and I took the first step today with a quick cleanup release of the site's theme. By my count, this current theme is the 11th distinct version of my site's design and this will be the 2nd update.

#### What's different?

+ Some images that didn't really make sense anymore were removed
+ New logo
+ Changed fonts—going back to Freight Text for the body copy and introducing Termina for headlines

#### What's next?

+ Create an area to share works in progress
+ Consider ditching the rotated navigation
