New year, new site, newfound inspiration. I’m not sure why, but blogging has never really stuck with me. The pressure of publishing regularly becomes a bit overwhelming, I suppose. That piece you wanted to sit down and bang out gets pushed back a few days. After all, there’s more important things to do. Days become weeks. Weeks become months. Interest wanes. Posts happen so sporadically that any type of connection with readers is lost.

I’m over that. Writing helps me think, see things differently and ultimately produce better work. The itch to start publishing content again has finally overtaken the laziness keeping me from it. So, with no preconceived notions that I can maintain a schedule or guarantee that this will ever be read by another human, I’m starting anew and it feels pretty good.
