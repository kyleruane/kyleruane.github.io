Website and logo design done in 2008 for a coffee roaster started by Dave Mustaine(!) and his wife Pam. Dave and Pam came up with the financial concept that was an extension of the name which was carried throughout the design. Products were called assets, celebrity endorsers (including Goldberg, remember Goldberg?) were principals, and specials were shown on an animated stock ticker. The store was on the Yahoo! small business platform and that coupled with the frameworks in place at Solid Cactus (where I worked during this project) left little room for experimentation in terms of layout, so the graphic had to provide the punch.
