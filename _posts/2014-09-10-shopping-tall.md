Finding clothes that fit well can be tough. Being 6’6”, I understand this as much as anyone. I’ve found that, while there are a fair amount of options for plus-sizes and even smaller sizes like extra small, pickins are slim for tall-sized items. These “tall-sized” pieces of clothing that I’m referencing are identical to normal ones, but have slightly longer mid-section and sleeves. It doesn’t sound like much, but it’s the difference between appearing to be a normal, sane person and walking around in a perpetual man version of a crop-top.

Although I’m forced to pass on nearly every screen printed t-shirt out there, I have found a few places offering longer shirts—they are listed below. Some are better than others for various reasons, but these all seem to be legitimate options.

I’m always searching for new stuff, so I plan on updating this list. Hopefully more brands and retailers consider tall options in the future—looking at you Everlane and Frank & Oak.

Suggestions are welcome? If you have any, shoot them over to me on twitter (_[@kyleruane](https://twitter.com/kyleruane)_) and I’ll add them above.
