It’s that time of the year again, when the leaves begin to turn, sweatshirts start to make their way out of the closet and pumpkin-flavored variations of nearly every damn thing hit store shelves. Although I do believe the pumpkin movement has jumped the shark at this point (it’s hard to argue that when you can purchase pumpkin flavored butter, potato chips and the like), I have to admit that I love it. I sneak pumpkin into anything I can—pancakes, coffee, pudding, whatever.

It is beer, however, that I most look forward to when pumpkin season hits. I try as many as possible each year. Here are my top 10 from last year.

1. Smuttynose Pumpkin Ale
2. Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin
3. Brewworks Devious Imperial Pumpkin
4. Dogfish Head Punkin Ale
5. Wolaver’s Pumpkin Ale
6. Southern Tier Pumking
7. Harpoon UFO Pumpkin
8. Long Trail Pumpkin Ale
9. Evil Genius Pumkinstein
10. Southampton Pumpkin Ale

Some surprises there, perhaps, but a lot of crowd favorites as well. Keep in mind that these are simply the ones I enjoyed the most and aren’t necessary ones that are rated the highest (check [beeradvocate](http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/72/) for that) and that most of these hail from the northeast, since that’s where I’m located. Am I missing any?

I’m looking forward to seeing how this year’s batches stack up. Cheers.
