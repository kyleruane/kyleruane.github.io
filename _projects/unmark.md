 <p>Unmark is a bookmarking system we built at Plain to help people turn the things they save from the web into actionable items. We call it the to-do list for bookmarks. It's a progressive web app that works across all devices.</p>
 <p>Project roles included UX considerations such as wireframes and user flow charts, feature planning and spec documents, interface design, icon design, branding, website design and development.</p>
