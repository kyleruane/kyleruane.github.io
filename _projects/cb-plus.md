 <p>Cotton Bureau Plus is a do-it-for-me solution for high profile people that want to offer merchandise but have no interest in managing the countless responsibilities that entailsâ€”product design, production, fulfillment, e-commerce, and customer service.</p>
 <p>Before the official launch at the start of 2019, we ran a pilot program for an entire year, building a system that allowed partners to have a branded storefront on the Cotton Bureau platform.</p>
