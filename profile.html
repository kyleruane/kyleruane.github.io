                        <h2>Currently</h2>

                        <p>Co-running a studio called Plain along with <a href="https://twitter.com/cdevroe">@cdevroe</a>. We built a couple of online products—an inline website editing system called Barley and a to-do list for bookmarks called Unmark. We are working on releasing v2 of Barley which is a fairly comprehensive overhaul that we think people are really going to love. We also design and build custom solutions for select clients and friends. Maybe you?</p>

                        <p>Always looking to partner with new people and companies with big ideas and a healthy budget. In need of some design help? Hit me up. While I don’t discriminate when accepting projects, I’m actively seeking anything from my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2016/06/16/bucket-list.html">Bucket List</a>.</p>

                        <p>A freelance designer, performing contract-based work for a number of mid-sized and large agencies, on both short and long-term engagements.</p>

                        <p>Design lead at a mid-sized eCommerce agency called Solid Cactus. I worked on both client projects and internal products, designing over 100 web stores for nearly every type of business—from small mom-and-pop stores to Fortune 100 corporations.</p>

                        <p>A swiss-army-knife at a small local advertising agency where I managed projects, designed for print/web/TV, developed an occasional website, handled media buying, and copy-wrote.</p>
